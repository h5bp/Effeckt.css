Ever notice how small flourishes and subtle transitions dramatically increases the value of the experience you enjoy with an app or site?

Designing and developing UIs for the mobile web is tricky, but it's extremely difficult to do that while delivering something that performs at 60fps. The best opportunities to getting jank-free transitions on phones/tablets are css transition and keyframe animation based, especially tapping into hardware-accelerated transforms and opacity changes.

@daneden did really nice work with [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/) but I think the web would benefit if we could take that work to the next level. There's already been fantastic experiments and demos exploring CSS-based transitions, but it's distributed all over. Here's a **few pieces of excellent work**

Because there are so many, I expect we could **group things by role**:
* button/touch effects
* state transition
* modal/notification transition
* attention attractors

## Goals 

This library/framework would come with some **goals**:

1. It provides no UI of it's own. It's only hooks for transitions.
1. Designer-curated set of classy and reasonable effects. (no [`easeInBounce`](http://easings.net/#easeInBounce))
1. Establish browser support guidelines (I expect Android 2.3 would gracefully degrade)
1. CSS performance regression testing (a la [bench.topcoat.io](http://bench.topcoat.io))
1. Deliver jank-free *60fps* performance on target browsers/devices
1. If a particular effect cannot deliver target performance (hey `blur()` css filter), it cannot be included. 
1. Guidelines on what to avoid when styling these affected elements (avoid expensive CSS)
1. Deliver a builder so users can pull only the CSS they need.
1. There is no hover on the mobile web, so any hover-based effects would be excluded.

## Action:

* If you know other transition/keyframe animation based demos/experiments that make senes to include here, file a ticket.
* If you're interested in helping to define the API let's hear it, comment on that ticket
* A web-based builder is a must. A cmd-line builder isn't important for this, I'd say.
